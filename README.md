# About RedditMin
This project is part of Codecademy's Full Stack course, and it consists of a webpage based on Reddit, extremely simplified.

The main, and only page of the site displays the top posts from Reddit's /r/all and /r/popular communities, toggled through a button. A search bar allows the user to filter results based on a post's title or author. Clicking on a post redirects towards Reddit.

While very rustic and with ample room for improvement, there are no future plans to better the app. The project was made solely for the purpose of completing an assignment.

RedditMin was made with React, therefore it incorporates HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Asides from the react library, react-icons was also included. For testing, Jest was applied.

## Development
To design the app, a wireframe was made, but as development proceeded, the idea of making the project have multiple pages was discarded and complexity was reduced to the minumum necessary to satisfy the requirements.

The Header, initially planned to be used on two pages, was the first component made. Soon after, the Post component was created. With the basic version of those components, focus shifted towards improving the styling of the page, to better resemble Reddit.

Once both main components of the webpage were created, inner components that make interaction possible were developed - the subreddit toggling button and the search bar.

After all was completed, the documentation was written.
